# Sampada-Ezee-Pair-Project-
As students of Kathmandu University School of Management, for the subject Evidence Based Business Analytics, the pair of two students Ezee Adhikary(207004)  and Sampada Dhungana (207033), tried to explore the dataset of Bangladesh. Under the guidance of our faculty, we tried to perform the pair project through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis to analyze the population dynamics and its distribution of Bangladesh. 
Firstly we performed data collection and cleaning, for the collection of data, we used a dataset through kaggle and performed the cleaning process through Excel using a power query. Our cleaning process included removing unwanted columns, nulls and duplicate contents. 
Similalry for the analysis we perfomed visualization and EDA. The major minor analysis performed through Jupyter lab and the visualization through Power BI provided us with insights that the division Dhaka and the city Dhaka is the most crowded division and city of Bangladesh. Similarly the multiple hypothesis testing provided us with approval of our initially set hypothesis which stated that The capital, Dhaka is the most populated city of Bangladesh.
