# Sampada-Ezee-Pair-Project-
As students of Kathmandu University School of Management, for the subject Evidence Based Business Analytics, the pair of two students Ezee Adhikary(207004)  and Sampada Dhungana (207033), tried to explore the dataset of Bangladesh. Under the guidance of our faculty, we tried to perform the pair project through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis to analyze the population dynamics and its distribution of Bangladesh. 
Firstly we performed data collection and cleaning, for the collection of data, we used a dataset through kaggle and performed the cleaning process through Excel using a power query. Our cleaning process included removing unwanted columns, nulls and duplicate contents. 
Similalry for the analysis we perfomed visualization and EDA. The major minor analysis performed through Jupyter lab and the visualization through Power BI provided us with insights that the division Dhaka and the city Dhaka is the most crowded division and city of Bangladesh. Similarly the multiple hypothesis testing provided us with approval of our initially set hypothesis which stated that The capital, Dhaka is the most populated city of Bangladesh.

The graph shows the trend of Dhaka division being the most crowded division of Bangladesh from the year 2001 to year 2022 which is a trend set from the year 1991.

Similarly among the cities the city Dhaka has been the most crowded city of Bangladesh through the years right from 1991, 2001 and 2022.

The visualization also supports the EDA performed through Jupyter lab which shows that the population of Bangladesh prefer to reside in the city of Dhaka. 

Reasons for Dhaka dominance

Through the analysis , we can conclude that Dhaka is the most densely populated city in Bangladesh. The major reasons behind Dhaka being the most populated city are : 

1. As a capital city, Dhaka acts as an administrative hub for the country. It accommodates national and international organizations, financial corporations and business houses. 
2. Dhaka provides a wide range of employment opportunities, and the Bangladeshi citizens from all over the country immigrate to Dhaka for it. 
3. Dhaka offers standard healthcare and educational services and the rapid urbanization also has contributed to an increase in population.
4. Dhaka also serves as a gateway for international trade. The airports, ports and roads facilitate the movement of people along with goods and services both nationally and internationally.
   
Implications of Analysis

1. The performed analysis which shows Dhakaâ€™s dominance in the Bangladesh has various implications such as 
2. Businesses can decide to select Dhaka as their new site location as it helps them capture a large consumer base.
3. Urban planners can take this domestic migration to Dhaka as an opportunity to capture the crowd  and plan it well along with making profits. 
4. The overcrowding of Dhaka should be focused by the government and should formulate policies to develop other divisions and cities to mitigate the domestic migration of the country. 
5. Understanding the immigration trend will help the government in allocation of resources, housing facilities and healthcare services according to the trend.
6. Businesses can build shopping malls and commercial buildings in the most crowded divisions such as Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajsahi to capture the booming market.
